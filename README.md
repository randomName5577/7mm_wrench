# 7mm_wrench
STL model of a 7mm wrench

I once needed a short 7mm wrench, but I did not have one. Instead of buying one to use only once, which I later did as part of a set, I decided to print one. I made it short to fit in tight spaces. From the image you can see how small they are compared to a pen and a very small 7mm wrench. There are two STL files, one of them is designed to be able to handle more torque. After looking at the first smaller one, I was scared it would not be able to withstand the needed torque for my application so I started printing a second one just in case. The small one worked just fine!
